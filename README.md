I enjoy re-reading old Tweets. This project was inspired by all of the wisdom shared on Twitter.

- Creating images intended to look like a nicely framed quote
- From there, upload the images to a digital picture frame, share them, etc.

The fastest way to get started is to [download](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive) your Twitter account history.
